'The image shows a screenshot from the game Minecraft. It depicts a perspective from inside a stone structure, looking outward through an open wooden door. The surroundings outside the door include a small, cobblestone and wood house with a thatched roof. The terrain is grassy, and there is a dirt path leading away from the structure. There is a game interface at the bottom of the image, displaying health and hunger bars, inventory items, and a pickaxe tool. A notification appears in the upper right corner about unlocking new recipes. The text "World record 1:56" is at the top of the image.'
